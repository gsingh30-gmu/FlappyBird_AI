# FlappyBird AI

This project showcases an AI model trained using reinforcement learning to play the game FlappyBird. The AI demonstrates exceptional performance, able to surpass the abilities of most human players.

## Features

- **Reinforcement Learning**: The AI is trained using reinforcement learning techniques.
- **Markov Decision Process**: The AI uses a Markov Decision Process (MDP) to make decisions in the game.
- **Q-learning**: Q-learning is employed as the policy for the AI.
- **Python Implementation**: The entire project is implemented in Python.
